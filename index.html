        <span class="text">
          The Computer Systems Servicing (CSS) strand is a specialized
          vocational course that focuses on the technical aspects of computer
          systems and their maintenance. This strand is designed to equip
          students with the knowledge and skills needed to diagnose, repair, and
          maintain computer hardware and software. Through a combination of
          theoretical lessons and hands-on practical training, students gain a
          deep understanding of computer systems and learn how to troubleshoot
          various issues that may arise.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text">
          One of the key areas of focus in the CSS strand is computer hardware.
          Students learn about the different components of a computer system,
          such as the motherboard, CPU, memory, and storage devices. They also
          learn how to assemble and disassemble computer systems, install and
          configure hardware components, and diagnose and resolve
          hardware-related problems. This knowledge is crucial in the field of
          computer servicing, as hardware failures are common and require
          technical expertise to fix.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text">
          In addition to hardware, the CSS strand also covers software-related
          topics. Students learn about operating systems, software installation,
          and configuration. They gain hands-on experience in installing and
          configuring different operating systems, such as Windows and Linux,
          and learn how to troubleshoot software-related issues. This knowledge
          is essential for ensuring the smooth operation of computer systems and
          optimizing their performance.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text">
          Another important aspect of the CSS strand is network troubleshooting
          and maintenance. Students learn about computer networks, including
          concepts such as IP addressing, subnetting, and network protocols.
          They acquire skills in setting up and configuring network devices,
          diagnosing network connectivity issues, and implementing security
          measures. With the increasing reliance on networked systems in today's
          world, these skills are highly valuable and in demand.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text">
          The CSS strand also emphasizes the importance of professionalism and
          customer service in the field of computer servicing. Students learn
          about effective communication skills, problem-solving techniques, and
          ethical practices. They understand the importance of providing timely
          and efficient service to customers, and how to manage customer
          expectations and handle challenging situations professionally. These
          soft skills are essential for building a successful career in computer
          systems servicing.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text">
          Throughout the course, students in the CSS strand engage in practical
          exercises and projects to apply their knowledge and skills. They work
          on real-world scenarios, troubleshooting common computer issues, and
          maintaining computer systems in a simulated environment. This hands-on
          approach allows them to develop their problem-solving abilities and
          gain the confidence needed to tackle complex computer servicing tasks.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text">
          Upon completion of the CSS strand, students have various career
          options available to them. They can work as computer technicians,
          providing technical support and maintenance services to individuals
          and organizations. They can also pursue further education in the field
          of computer science or information technology, specializing in areas
          such as system administration, network engineering, or cybersecurity.
          The skills and knowledge acquired in the CSS strand provide a solid
          foundation for further career growth and development.
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="text">
          In summary, the Computer Systems Servicing (CSS) strand is a
          vocational course that equips students with the technical skills and
          knowledge needed to diagnose, repair, and maintain computer systems.
          From hardware troubleshooting to software installation and network
          maintenance, students gain a comprehensive understanding of computer
          servicing. Additionally, they develop important soft skills, such as
          communication and problem-solving abilities, as well as
          professionalism and customer service. With a hands-on approach and
          practical exercises, students are prepared for various career
          opportunities in the field of computer systems servicing or further
          education in related disciplines.
